Brackets-CSSCodeHints
=======================

**This project is not maintained. I no longer use Adobe Brackets so this extension is no longer maintained. I'm interested in porting this to VS Code. If you can help please get in touch!**

Extend Brackets CSS code hints with more CSS attributes.

Complete list of properties and attributes added:

* background-size ("initial", "inherit")
* caption-side ("right, "left")
* clip-path ("auto, "inherit")
* image-rendering ("auto", "crisp-edges", "inherit", "pixelated")
* tab-size
* touch-action ("auto", "none", "pan-x", "pan-y")
* user-select
* will-change

If you spot a CSS attribute missing that you'd like added please open an issue or pull-request.
